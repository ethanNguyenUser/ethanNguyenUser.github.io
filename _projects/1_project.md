You can check my public notes on [ethann.netlify.app](https://ethann.netlify.app)

Near the end sophomore year in college, I realized that it is impossible to remember every detail learned from my classes, so I've gotten into a habit of taking linked, semantic notes using the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) note-taking software. With linked notes, I find I that if I can only recall a certain subset of a subject I want to relearn, I can simply go through the connected web of notes and refresh my understanding. I'm using Obsidian as my personal knowledge management system (KMS) for now because it uses markdown files, which are likely to be usable for decades, the many plugins it offers such as LaTeX suite makes note taking quick and easy, and its linking capabilities allows notes to modular and organized.
