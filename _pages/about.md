I'm Ethan, a third-year at UCLA majoring in Biophysics and minoring in Data Science Engineering. My current interests include neurophysics, medical technologies, and mathematics. 

This site serves mostly as a hub to other links such as my email, Github, LinkedIn, Youtube channel, personal projects, and resume. Have fun exploring!
